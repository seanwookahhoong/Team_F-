                            <p>Hi there, I'm Thng Chen.

I'm in Singapore Polytechnic, Diploma in Mechanical Engineering Year 1.

I always wonder how objects looks on the inside. I would take apart objects and google what does what and why.<br/>
I will often look for the quickest way to solve an issue which enables me to overcome challenges quickly. <br/>
I’m most intrigued by the television series “How It’s Made”. It always satisfies my curiosity.<br/>
I like to explore new places and learn new skills. I enjoy the alone time I have to explore the area or learn more of the culture.</p>

                              I am like the other members in wanting to understand in how a machine works even down to its simplest form
                              so it is an hornour that i am able to be a part of this programmme!<br/>

                            <p>Hi guys, Wei Shen here <br />
I'm currently a year 1 studying mechanical engineering in Singapore polytechnic<br />
As I am always curious about vehicles especially cars, this drives me to join my current course in order for me to better understand how does different machines or engines functions.<br />
Though the past semester, it have really broaden by knowledge as who would know that even such a basic material that we call steel would have a huge list of different composition that would produce different type of steel<br />
I am glad that I manage to join this course and I hope to continue to widen my knowledge in hopes to enter the related industries.</p>

                            <p>Hey! Yong Ziab here!
                              I love the great outd-, wait no, indoors. <br />
                              My hobbies are reading, food and sleeping. <br/>
                              I can go on all day about PC hardware. Also, cats.<br />
                              I'm inquisitive and seek out details on any subject or matter that interest me
                              so it is great that I have the opportunity to have a chance in being part of the Enginnering Accademmy progamme
                              which was so much fun.
