                                <td>This is our launcher that we have created during the course of the three days. It is able to be functional with a little human force but
                                it is still not the launcher that we wanted to build due to us being really new to this kind of thing and the fact that we had so little time to do
                                it.</td>
                              </tr>
                            </table>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>These were the major problems that of our launcher:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Firstly, the slot for the airplane to rest and shoot off was a bit too wide and short, the air plane couldn't even shoot out of the launcher that far in the begining when we didn't increase the rps of the motors
                               Also, our air planes were too long and could not fit into the slot perfectly and had to be held by human hands</li>
                              <li>Secondly, the rubber on the wheels(as shown in the picture) did not stick to the wheel properly and thus when we tried to increase the power of the wheels the rubber stretched and
                                thus the motors could not be turned on for long periods of time and could not be used for the long term </li>
                              <li>Finally, for our design we did not consider a incline to make the paper airplane to shoot even further(in the picture the launcher was inclining to a certian angle as there was
                                 something that is not part of our design under it) with the incline the air plane could have shot even futher without the need to massively increase the motor speed and thus save more power and resources for the long term</li>
                            </ul>
                    <p>In conclusion, our design was very flawed, it has a lot of problems and there were much more problems we had tho solve along the way and it could be much much better. <br/>
                    However, for first timers in this kind of machine building in the EA tryouts, in our opinion, we did the best we could and the result is pretty surprising honestly since we only had three days to build the machine
                    while also learning about other stuf like coding. <br/> Thus, this tryout was really helpful as we learned so many things in so little time and a really good experience in general.
