                    On the first day, nobody really knew each other. There was also confusion over what was going on. 

After things settled down, the lecturers went on to introduce themselves and the EAP. We were then given an icebreaking activity, which was the first task of the program: build a bridge out of ice cream sticks that can span a 30cm gap and hold a load. Our team decided to rest the ice cream sticks on their horizontal edges and then glue them together. This design, surprisingly, allowed our team's bridge to hold the most weight out of all the bridges. 

With the bridge building activity done, the next activity was to make something that can carry a message across a room. We built a plane, a crude slingshot and a ninja star. The plane, unsurprisingly, turned out to be the best performing overall out of the 3 items. 

The lecturers then revealed we had to build a plane launcher, which was what we did over the remainder of the tryouts.

Overall, after the initial awkwardness, we found that we were able to collaborate with each other rather well. This helped set a healthy precedent for the rest of the tryouts.
