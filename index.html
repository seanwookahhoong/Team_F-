                    <p>This is the home page of team F* projects. Here is where you will see our inventions and what we come up with for the EA programme</p>
                      <p> On our website you will see our projects and what we do in Engineering accademy! <br /> More details on our <a href="blog.html">blog</a>:)</P>
                      <p>The project we are currently working on is inventing a machine to send messages on paper accross a certian distance:o<br /> We have been working for a number of days on this project and have come up wth the following ideas:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ninja star</li>
                      <li>rubber band sling shot</li>
                      <li>Paper airplane</li>
                    </ul>

                    <table width="100%" background-color="white">
                      <tr>
                        <td><img class="img" src="Images/ninjastar.jpeg" width="200px"></td>
                        <td>This is our first idea we thought it was a good idea because it can be thrown long distances, however it is not that accurate and it would be very hard to make a launcher such that it is accurate and far travelling </td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p></p>

                    <table width="100%" background-color="white">
                      <tr>
                        <td><img img class="img" src="Images/rubberband.jpeg" width="200px"></td>
                        <td>This is our second design, where we would make a catapult to shoot the paper message across a certian distance. It is covers the most distance
                        among the three designs but however we would need more experince before we could make a automated catapult for our design so sadly it had to be scrapped </td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p></p>

                        <td>Then for our final design, the paper airplane, it is the best choice for the design as it is easy to design a launcher and make it for use where it can shoot the airplane
                        accurately and far!  </td>
                      </tr>
